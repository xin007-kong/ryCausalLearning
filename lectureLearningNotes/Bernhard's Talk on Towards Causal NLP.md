- 概括一下 talk 的内容
- Machine learning relies on correlations rather than causality, which can lead to limitations in object recognition and adversarial vulnerability.
- Causal inference connects correlation and causality, suggesting that statistically dependent variables have a causal explanation.

* Structural causal models provide a formalism for thinking about causality, using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent causal relationships.
* Causal factorization allows the joint distribution to be expressed as a product of conditionals, reducing the dimensionality of the variables.
* The goal is to move towards causal representation learning, combining interventional knowledge and learned representations for richer and more data-efficient world models.
